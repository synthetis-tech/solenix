## Configuration

Solenix is configured via a YAML file passed with `--config`:

```bash
solenix serve --config solenix.yaml
```

If no config is provided, all defaults are used.

### Full reference

# How often WAL data is flushed to immutable chunk files.
# Accepts Go duration strings: "30s", "2m", "1h".

### Data directory

Data is always stored at `~/.solenix/data/<database>/` and cannot be changed via config.
Each database directory contains:

```
~/.solenix/data/
├── VERSION              # on-disk format version
└── default/
    ├── .lock            # prevents opening the same database twice
    ├── wal/             # write-ahead log segments (000001.wal, ...)
    └── chunks/          # immutable time-series chunk files
```
